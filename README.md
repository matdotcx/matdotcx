## Preamble

My name isn’t too important. In fact, it’s the thing about me that matters the least, I’d think. For the record, it’s posted at the top of this page, and you’ve found your way here, so I’m sure you can work it out. I was born in South London to Italian parents, but extended exposure to the UK has given me a penchant for tea, postcards and the BBC Shipping Forecast.
 
I attended good Catholic schools in accordance with my parent’s wishes and learnt there that it’s not the label one carries, but the intent one has that matters. I lived in London until 2019, with a small gap spent in Canterbury, Kent between 2001 and 2004, where I read for my Anthropology BSc and became a fancy-pants Liberal Arts/Science student with a beard. 

I now live in the Cotswolds, with a loving partner and two wonderful children. I still have the beard, but it's substantially more specked with grey.
